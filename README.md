# ABOUT
This is a simple project to practise my HTML and CSS skills. I used my knowledge of pseudo-selectors, 
pseudo-elements, animation and other things... to make this.

# HOW

The logic is similar to when you use JS to add a ".active" class to your tags when clicking on the toggle menu, 
I just used this logic using checkbox and  the :checked pseudo-element
